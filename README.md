BikeRouter
=========

BikeRouter was created as part of SF-CHAMP (San Francisco's Activity-Based Travel 
Demand Model) in order to represent the impact of bicycle facilities.

BikeRouter's main components:
(1) tools to compile, clean, and screen bicycle route data collected with 
the CycleTracks smart phone application.
(2) tools to generate a set of possible path choices and create a viable
estimation dataset suitable to estimate a path size logit route choice model.
(3) tools to generate log-sums of the path choice set in order to inform
a series of mode-choice models
(4) bike assignment algorithms to simulate a bicyle assignment given
demand between origins and destinations.
